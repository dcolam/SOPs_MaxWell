## Your First Recording

At this point, you should have done your first training with a staff member, so if possible refer to the specific recording strategies discussed in the training. This tutorial serves as a basic reminder of the most basic workflow, an activity scan and network assay.

### Assess whether you have biological meaningful signal

At the beginning of your experimental journey, it might be difficult to evaluate whether you have biologically meaningful signal.

### The Activity Scan Assay

As a reminder, an activity scan assay is necessary to determine the most active areas of your chips. If your cells are not as active or still very young, you might need to perform an activity scan every single session. In general, it is recommended to lose a little bit of spatial resolution to gain more temporal resolution, especially if your cells are not very active.

Go to the Assay Tab and make sure to change the project to your specific project (IMPORTANT!!). Open a new Assay and choose Activity Scan. As a start, I would recommend to choose the Checker Board configuration and scan for at least 90s per configuration. This is a good compromise between temporal and spatial resolution. Of course, feel free to adjust the settings to your liking by either in- or decreasing the spatial resolution (e.g. Full Scan) or scanning time (sometimes, with highly connected mature neuronal networks, cells become active only in infrequent bursts, in which case the timing should be increased to 120-180s to avoid banding artifacts due to inactivity).

A whole Activity Assay might take up the majority of your session. If your cells are in a more matured state (typically after they start bursting) you might not need to repeat the Activity Assays every session and you could reuse the same map for several recordings.

### The Network Assay

A network assay records a specific configuration (typically the results of an Activity Assay) for a pre-defined period of time. Typically and depending on the activity of your cells, 5 to 10min are sufficient.

Here, you will typically need the result of an Activity Assay to choose the areas of interest to perform the Network Assay. Experiment with different configurations but stick to a specific one once you are happy with a type of configuration. We typically use Feature Maximization to always have the maximum number of electrodes (around 1020).

You can queue the Network Assay recording to take place right after your Activity Scan, just make sure that it is configured to take the newest Activity Scan results (which will appear black it is still running).

### Advanced Topic - Repeated Network Assays with Waiting Blocks

For pharmacological treatments, you might want to perform repeated measurements spaced out evenly. MaxWell does not support this out of the box but there is a work-around to still perform it in an unsupervised way. Please, still make sure that you book the corresponding time slots!

##### Waiting Blocks - Record Assay

These are technically speaking not waiting blocks but they can be used as such. To configure one, choose a Record Assay and configure it to have a short record time (typically 1min). Then choose as an in-between cycle half of the wished waiting time (so, 30min for 1hr wait block), and repeat it for 3 cycles. Check on the "Estimate Time" button if the waiting block is correct.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you choose any configuration, a blank one will skip the waiting block. You can just click on "Choose Current Configuration".

We can take advantage of the queuing of assays. By alternating Network Assays with Waiting Blocks (Record Assays), we can space out recordings and have repeated measurements. You will need to open new assays and start them in the order you want to have them run.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I know that my cells are fine?

This might be difficult to assess, since cells are not visible on the surface fo the sensors. We recommend to plate sister cultures in parallel on glass coverslips to have a general idea of the health of your cultures. In case of older cultures, you might start seeing a matt coating on the surface. If the media changes color to a more orange hue is also an indication that your cells are still metabolically active. Make sure, this is not due to a fungal or bacterial contamination which turns the media very quickly yellow with a cloudy layer on top of the sensor area. If this is the case, terminate the experiment immediately to avoid cross-contaminations, especially if you keep your cells in our cell culture facilities.

#### When can I expect neuronal activity in my cells?

This is highly dependent on your specific cells and even culturing conditions. Empirically, we start seeing neuronal activity from Day 14-18 for iPSC-derived neuronal cultures (with forward programming) and start of bursting activity from Day 18 up to 35. For primary neuronal cultures from rodents, activity starts much earlier from Day7 and start of bursting typically around Day 10-14. Your mileage may vary.
