## 

The **electrophysiology Platform for High-throughput and Advanced Cell-based assays (e-PHAC)** is a core research facility at the University of Zurich that provides access to advanced electrophysiology technologies for the functional analysis of excitable cell systems.

e-PHAC supports users by maintaining state-of-the-art instrumentation, offering hands-on training, and providing guidance on experimental workflows and best practices. The facility serves a broad range of research applications, including neuronal and cardiac models, stem-cell–derived systems, and pharmacological assays.

This tutorial describes practical workflows for the use of the MaxTwo system as implemented at e-PHAC. The procedures and recommendations presented here are based on accumulated experience across multiple projects and are intended to complement the official documentation provided by the instrument manufacturer.
