    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow do I know that my cells are healthy?\nThis can be difficult to assess, as cells are not visible on the surface of the sensors. We recommend plating sister cultures in parallel on glass coverslips to obtain a general indication of culture health.\nIn older cultures, you may start to see a matte coating on the sensor surface. A gradual change in media color toward a more orange hue is also an indication that cells are still metabolically active.\nMake sure that these changes are not caused by fungal or bacterial contamination, which typically turns the media bright yellow very quickly and produces a cloudy layer on top of the sensor area. If contamination is suspected, terminate the experiment immediately to avoid cross-contamination—especially when using shared cell culture facilities.\n\n\nWhen can I expect neuronal activity in my cells?\nThis depends strongly on the cell type and culturing conditions.\nEmpirically:\n\niPSC-derived neuronal cultures (forward programming):\n\nInitial activity: Day 14–18\nOnset of bursting: Day 18–35\n\nPrimary rodent neuronal cultures:\n\nInitial activity: ~Day 7\nOnset of bursting: Day 10–14\n\n\nThese timeframes are approximate, and results may vary depending on experimental conditions.",

    "section": "Assess Whether You Have Biologically Meaningful Signals",
    "text": "Assess Whether You Have Biologically Meaningful Signals\nAt the beginning of your experimental journey, it might be difficult to evaluate whether you are observing biologically meaningful signals.\n\nThe Activity Scan Assay\nAs a reminder, an activity scan assay is necessary to determine the most active areas of your chip. If your cells are still young or not very active, you may need to perform an activity scan during every session.\nIn general, it is recommended to sacrifice some spatial resolution in order to gain temporal resolution, especially when working with low-activity cultures.\nTo set up an Activity Scan:\n\nGo to the Assay tab.\nChange the Project to your specific project (IMPORTANT).\nOpen a new assay and choose Activity Scan.\nSelect the Checkerboard configuration.\nScan for at least 90 seconds per configuration.\n\nThis setup provides a good compromise between temporal and spatial resolution. You can adjust the settings by increasing or decreasing the spatial resolution (e.g. Full Scan) or the scan duration.\nIn some cases—especially with highly connected, mature neuronal networks—cells may become active only in infrequent bursts. In these situations, increasing the scan duration to 120–180 seconds can help avoid banding artifacts caused by inactivity.\nA full Activity Scan may take up most of your session time. Once your cultures reach a more mature state (typically after bursting begins), you may not need to repeat the Activity Scan every session and can reuse the same activity map for multiple recordings.\n\n\nThe Network Assay\nA Network Assay records a specific electrode configuration—typically derived from the results of an Activity Scan—for a predefined period of time. Depending on the activity level of your cells, a recording duration of 5–10 minutes is usually sufficient.\nYou will typically use the results of an Activity Scan to select areas of interest for the Network Assay. Experiment with different configurations initially, but once you are satisfied, it is recommended to remain consistent across sessions.\nWe typically use Feature Maximization to include the maximum number of electrodes (approximately 1020 electrodes).\nYou can queue the Network Assay to start immediately after the Activity Scan. Make sure that the Network Assay is configured to use the newest Activity Scan results, which will appear black while the scan is still running.\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: Repeated Network Assays with Waiting Blocks\nFor pharmacological treatments, you may want to perform repeated measurements that are evenly spaced in time. MaxWell does not support this functionality directly, but a workaround allows you to perform repeated recordings in an unsupervised manner.\nMake sure to book the corresponding time slots to accommodate the full sequence.\n\nWaiting Blocks Using Record Assays\nAlthough these are technically not true waiting blocks, Record Assays can be used to simulate them.\nTo configure a waiting block:\n\nCreate a Record Assay.\nSet a short recording duration (typically 1 minute).\nSet the in-between cycle time to half of the desired waiting period\n(e.g. 30 minutes for a 1-hour waiting block).\nRepeat the assay for 3 cycles.\nUse the Estimate Time button to verify that the waiting block is configured correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nYou must select a configuration for the Record Assay. If the configuration is left blank, the waiting block will be skipped.\nYou can simply click “Choose Current Configuration.”\n\n\nBy alternating Network Assays with Waiting Blocks (Record Assays), you can space out recordings and perform repeated measurements. You will need to open and queue the assays in the exact order in which you want them to run.",
