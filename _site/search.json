This tutorial serves as a basic reminder of the most basic workflow, an activity scan and network assay.\n\n\nAt the beginning of your experimental journey, it might be difficult to evaluate whether you have biologically meaningful signal.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, an activity scan assay is necessary to determine the most active areas of your chips. If your cells are not as active or still very young, you might need to perform an activity scan every single session. In general, it is recommended to lose a little bit of spatial resolution to gain more temporal resolution, especially if your cells are not very active.\nGo to the Assay Tab and make sure to change the project to your specific project (IMPORTANT!!). Open a new Assay and choose Activity Scan. As a start, I would recommend to choose the Checker Board configuration and scan for at least 90s per configuration. This is a good compromise between temporal and spatial resolution. Of course, feel free to adjust the settings to your liking by either in- or decreasing the spatial resolution (e.g. Full Scan) or scanning time (sometimes, with highly connected mature neuronal networks, cells become active only in infrequent bursts, in which case the timing should be increased to 120-180s to avoid banding artifacts due to inactivity).\nA whole Activity Assay might take up the majority of your session. If your cells are in a more matured state (typically after they start bursting) you might not need to repeat the Activity Assays every session and you could reuse the same map for several recordings.\n\n\n\nA network assay records a specific configuration (typically the results of an Activity Assay) for a pre-defined period of time. Typically and depending on the activity of your cells, 5 to 10min are sufficient.\nHere, you will typically need the result of an Activity Assay to choose the areas of interest to perform the Network Assay. Experiment with different configurations but stick to a specific one once you are happy with a type of configuration. We typically use Feature Maximization to always have the maximum number of electrodes (around 1020).\nYou can queue the Network Assay recording to take place right after your Activity Scan, just make sure that it is configured to take the newest Activity Scan results (which will appear black it is still running).\n\n\n\nFor pharmacological treatments, you might want to perform repeated measurements spaced out evenly. MaxWell does not support this out of the box but there is a work-around to still perform it in an unsupervised way. Please, still make sure that you book the corresponding time slots!\n\n\nThese are technically speaking not waiting blocks but they can be used as such. To configure one, choose a Record Assay and configure it to have a short record time (typically 1min).

Check on the “Estimate Time” button if the waiting block is correct.\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you choose any configuration, a blank one will skip the waiting block. You can just click on “Choose Current Configuration”.\nWe can take advantage of the queuing of assays.

    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow do I know that my cells are fine?\nThis might be difficult to assess, since cells are not visible on the surface fo the sensors. We recommend to plate sister cultures in parallel on glass coverslips to have a general idea of the health of your cultures. In case of older cultures, you might start seeing a matt coating on the surface. If the media changes color to a more orange hue is also an indication that your cells are still metabolically active. Make sure, this is not due to a fungal or bacterial contamination which turns the media very quickly yellow with a cloudy layer on top of the sensor area. If this is the case, terminate the experiment immediately to avoid cross-contaminations, especially if you keep your cells in our cell culture facilities.\n\n\nWhen can I expect neuronal activity in my cells?\nThis is highly dependent on your specific cells and even culturing conditions. Empirically, we start seeing neuronal activity from Day 14-18 for iPSC-derived neuronal cultures (with forward programming) and start of bursting activity from Day 18 up to 35. For primary neuronal cultures from rodents, activity starts much earlier from Day7 and start of bursting typically around Day 10-14. Your mileage may vary.",

    "text": "This is a very short tutorial on how you should handle the MaxWell plates and prepare them in order to seed your cells. Please, carefully read also the official MaxWell protocols. These are just our recommendations based on empirical data across many different project that we encountered at the facility.\nThere is no guarantee that it will work with these protocols and there might be some optimization steps necessary to find the right conditions for your cells.\n\n\n\n\nIf you own a 6-well plate, you will need to first pre-treat the plates and sterilize them. The pre-treatment with 1% Terg-a-zyme will make the surface of the sensor more hydrophilic. After preparing the 1% Terg-a-zyme in sterile ddH2O water, you can fill the chips and incubate it for 2-3 hours (up to over-night) at room temperature. Afterwards, you should thoroughly wash/rinse the plates with ddH2O (typically 3-4 times with 2-3ml).\nFor sterilization, spray down all other surfaces of the plate thoroughly with 70% EtOH, place your plates under a sterile environment (cell culture hood) and fill all wells and places around the wells with cell culture grade 70% EtOH. Make sure that the gold pins in at the bottom of the plates are as dry as possible as they corrode easily which will affect the recordings. Incubate the 70% for at least 30min under the hood (do not use UV-light as it can affect the longevity of the electronics).\nAfterwards, rinse the plates with ddH2O 3-4 times and let it dry under the hood till first use.\n\n\n\nMaxWell ships the 24-well plates already sterile, so you can directly continue with the pre-treatment steps. If you are re-using the plate (cell-free) you can perform the same steps as described above.\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to perform a pre-condition of the plates, especially before the first use. This is done by incubating the sterilized plates with sterile media in your incubator for 1-2 days. No need to perform a washing step before coating.\n\n\n\nBefore seeding your cells, the surface of the sensors need to be coated in order to provide a good surface for your cells to adhere. This is especially true for the surfaces of the HD-MEA sensors as they are smoother than typical cell-culture grade plastic-ware.\nWe always recommend to try the typical coating protocols that work with your type of cells, especially if you have experience seeding your cells on glass coverslips. If you normally don’t coat your surfaces before seeding your cells, we recommend as a starting point to coat the surfaces first with Poly-D (or L)-Lysine (PDL or PLL) overnight in an incubator, followed by a Laminin (20ng/uL) coating of 1-hr in the incubator before seeding your cells. Wash with ddH2O or PBS in-between steps.\nIn order to save Laminin solution, you can just coat the sensor area directly. Make sure to cover the whole area (~50uL). It is also recommended by many to not dry out the surfaces after coating.\n\n\n\nAfter coating, your plates are ready to be seeded with cells. It is recommended to have a pilot experiment were different number of cells are seeded at different concentrations. Typically, we seed from 50’000-150’000 per well on the sensor area. The sensor area is covered by around 50uL of solution, so concentrate your cells accordingly. After seeding, place the plates back into the incubator for 1hr (no longer, as you risk to evaporate the 50uL), followed by carefully filling up the well (~500-600ul per well (24-well), 1-1.5ml per well (6-well)).\nProceed with normal cell culture routine.",
